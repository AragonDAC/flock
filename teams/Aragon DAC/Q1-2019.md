# Aragon Flock Proposal: Aragon DAC<img align="right" src="https://wiki.aragon.org/design/logo/aragon_dac/logo_horizontal_transbg_small.png" height="80px" />

## Summary

We, the [Aragon DAC](http://aragondac.org/), are [the second development team](https://medium.com/aragon-dac/aragon-dac-a-new-community-effort-to-foster-aragons-development-led-by-giveth-2228dcc17b63) to begin building out core Aragon infrastructure. We would like to continue our efforts to improve the Aragon stack. 

This Flock proposal outlines the development projects the Aragon DAC plans to tackle in the next 6 months. 


We will spend 75% of our time continuing the development of: 
* **aragonCLI**
* **aragonAPI**
* **hack.aragon.org**
* **Dapp-DAO Interactions**

15% of our time on new development projects: 
* **Function Registry DAO**
* **LiquidFunding & Liquid Democracy**

And 10% of our time on developing a strong Aragon Ecosystem with these outreach projects:
* **Online Office Hour Appointments**
* **In-Person Events**

One of our long term goals is to **build a sustainable consulting service** into our community to bring outside funding into the improvement of the Aragon ecosystem and we will make important steps in that direction during these next 6 months.

To accomplish these objectives, we are requesting a 333,000 DAI one-time payment, plus 80,000 ANT with 1-year cliff and 4-year vesting period.

This is the first of many Flock proposals by the Aragon DAC. We hope to expand this team and spin out a user-focused Community R&D group in future Flock proposals to continue **our mission** to build the future of human collaboration with Aragon.  

Note: This markdown file is an outline pulled from a more detailed proposal that can be viewed [**here**.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mQOWdZtCIBmXP5q8OcpZyhj9d8kqQ1zl9JLxJcHA5Zs/edit#) Please feel free to **comment** on this document.

## Deliverables

We expect to take an **agile approach**, adapting our scope based on community feedback to an **open monthly status call** and on Github.

**Metrics** are important to us. We will begin establishing quantifiable goals after baseline metrics have been collected in Q1.

### Improving Developer Experience (devX)
<details><summary>...</summary>

  
**Our primary goal**: Give the community of developers building on top of Aragon a **solid foundation** to innovate upon.


**Metrics** to measure success:
* Watches, stars, and forks of Aragon repos
* [Downloads](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=%40aragon%2Fcli&from=2018-01-01&to=2019-01-01) of Aragon packages 
* Traffic metrics for hack.aragon.org and developer-oriented blog posts 
* Issues opened and closed in hack, CLI and API repos
* Requests for office hours

#### 101 aragonCLI
<details><summary>...</summary>
   
We will own, maintain, and improve the aragonCLI repo, focusing on stability and robustness.
* **Specific goals**:
    * Make it easy to [**build custom DAOs**](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/299) 
    * **Support for Windows**, a variety of nodeJS versions and web3 providers
    * [Refactor the repo](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/319) to achieve separation and speed
    * Strive for [100% **code coverage** testing](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/331)
* **Guiding Values**:
    * Anything that can be done through an Aragon UI should be possible through the CLI 
    * **Fast turnaround** on other Flock teams feature requests
    *  Give special attention and prioritization to teams external to Aragon looking to integrate their own platform's features, for example (there are no plans for these features):
        *  Calling functions in DAOs from a [Status chat room](https://devpost.com/software/dao-to-go)
        *  Easy CDP creation on the DAI Dashboard
</details> 

#### 102 aragonAPI
<details><summary>...</summary>
   
We will own, maintain, and improve the aragonAPI repo focusing on stability and robustness. 
* **Specific goals**: 
    * Ensure the stability of aragon.js 
        * Maintaining support for **multiple browsers** and various nodeJS versions
        * Creating and implementing a testing strategy
        * Creating a formal specification
    * Improve developer experience 
        * Create case studies on how the Voting app and the Token Manager app use the API

</details>

#### 103 hack.aragon.org
<details><summary>...</summary>

We will own, maintain, and improve hack.aragon.org. 

* **Specific goals**:
    * [Move hack.aragon.org to a new design](https://github.com/aragon/hack/issues/64) (Assisted by A1)
    * Implement feature improvements
        * Feedback mechanisms to help surface areas that need more work 
        * Additional features are listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B1nyb95LgBtrWY8Av0FnvnpUfvOb13wfjGZb28svSVs/edit#heading=h.8jcnm69vst4)
    * Do general day-to-day maintenance, responding to feedback

        * Give a deeper understanding detailing why the tools work the way they do 
        * Illustrate the ideal development flow for a real world application
</details>
</details>

### Enabling Dapp-DAO Interactions
<details>
  <summary>... 
   </summary>
  
**Our primary goal**: Enable Aragon DAOs to take actions on external Dapps. We have a working prototype in Frame that we will continue to develop. See [our 4 minute demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqb3fLNa7U8&feature=youtu.be).

**Metrics** to measure success:
* Being able to import an Aragon DAO and sign transactions with it (Provider)
* Number of Aragon DAOs using external Dapps (Provider)
* Number of functions registered (Function Registry DAO)

Our development stream for this complicated objective has been divided into 4 parts:

#### 201 Keyring and Provider Engine
<details><summary>...</summary>
   
**[Keyring Engine](https://github.com/jvluso/eth-aragon-keyring)**
* Enables Aragon DAOs to interact through custom web3 providers 
    * Allows a DAO to be selected as the user identity in a **browser**
    * The result of a **button click** in a Dapp will initiate a **vote** on whether that action should be performed in the Aragon DAO
    * We have a [working prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqb3fLNa7U8&feature=youtu.be)
* Uses Frame for browser support
    * We are focusing 100% on building and testing this functionality on Frame
    * Current design is compatible with MetaMask
    * Long term goal is support for various desktop and mobile applications

**Provider Engine**
* Similar functionality as the Keyring engine but for **CLI** applications like truffle and future extensions 
* [Almost complete](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/pull/165) but needs to be continuously updated and maintained 

**Specific Goals**: 
* Finish the development of these tools
* Support and maintain their core functionality upon completion
</details>

#### 202 Frame Integration
<details><summary>...</summary>
   
We need to continue integrating the Provider Engine into Frame so that any DAO can be added to Frame’s interface. 

**Specific Goals**: 
* Build up the transaction flow 
* Add more information to the confirm screen
* Work with various Dapps to improve Frame compatibility
    * Currently working with Gitcoin developers to make Frame compatible with their Dapp
* Optimizing the integration will require the Agent app to be finalized 
</details>

#### 203 Agent/Actor App
<details><summary>...</summary>
   
We will assist in the development of the [Agent/Actor app](https://forum.aragon.org/t/actor-app-arbitrary-actions-from-daos/275/14) as needed to support the integration of the Aragon Keyring and other related functionality. 
</details>

#### 204 Function Registry DAO
<details><summary>...</summary>
   
Currently a vote for calling an external function lacks a human readable description making for poor UX around voting on these proposed actions. 

Our proposed solution: 
*  Allow developers, or possibly users, to input a decription, that can be later certified by a DAO
    1. The description is stored in a registry
    2. When displayed in a vote, the description has LOUD warnings advising voters not to trust the description, that it may be malicious and result in loss of DAO funds
    3. These warnings can be removed when the registry's entry is certified by the Function Registry DAO
    4. This DAO will start as a simple 2-of-n multisig Aragon DAO with known and trusted Aragon developers from Flock teams as members, but will evolve as needed

* Execution
    1. We will create a comprehensive specification for the registry
    2. Gather Flock team members' approval of the specification and support to become members of the DAO
    3. Build out the registry
    4. Deploy the DAO
    5. Seed the registry with expected common entries
    6. Create a short tutorial for best practices when creating an entry
</details>
</details>
 
### Developing Use Cases
<details><summary>...</summary>
  
 **Our primary goal**: To learn and document how to efficiently use the Aragon stack for building and operating DAOs.

**Metrics** to measure success:
* It's important to establish metrics that don’t promote overuse and a misallocation of development time 
    * Experimental vote turnout within the team
    * Number of Apps installed in the DAC’s DAO
    * Execution on the Status DAO Roadmap (qualitative)
    * Number of issues submitted by organizations asking for development assistance closed by us
    

#### 301 Internal Use Cases
<details><summary>...</summary>
   
Hands-on experimentation with Aragon DAOs needs to be undertaken, and we, as a blockchain-based entity, are well positioned to attempt these experiments and document the results.

We will create our own Aragon DAO for our own organization and do the following:
* Take signals from the [research forums](https://forum.aragon.org/c/DAO-use-cases) for what apps to install
* Vote with our Aragon DAO on whether or not to install each app
* Document their use with short Medium posts
* Make bug reports and create issues
* Avoid being distracted by our own usage of these tools
    * We have experience with this from using the Giveth DApp

While developing the Function Registry DAO we will do the following:
* Gain practice onboarding a friendly technical audience to a simple DAO
* Document its use with short Medium posts
* Make bug reports and create issues
* Examine best practices to encourage participation
</details>

#### 302 External Development Support
<details>
  <summary>... 
   </summary>
   
We strive to support external development teams’ desired functionality of the platform. Through this practice we expect to do the following:
* Gain valuable perspective on features needed for developers unfamiliar with the Aragon stack 
* Receive external validation of the developer experience using our tooling which will feed into the prioritization of development streams
* Direct external teams to use normal git flow for feature request and bug reporting

Our long term intention is to turn this work into a revenue stream by consulting with organizations to develop the tools needed for their desired governance models and onboard their teams to their own Aragon DAO.


#### LiquidFunding and Liquid Democracy
<details><summary>...</summary>
   
[Status](https://status.im) is in the process of Designing a DAO for the governance of their platform. See this [post](https://discuss.status.im/t/status-network-layer-1-liquid-funding/747/2) for more details.

* With our assistance Status will build on top of  Aragon; **without it they will build their own custom UI**
* Status has a strong desire to implement a LiquidFunding Governance model
    * LiquidFunding is essentially [Liquid Democracy for Fund Management](https://youtu.be/peYWgiS2Hmo?t=657)
        * It is a very novel governance system that doesn't require voting 
        * Giveth developed the contracts and two UIs for them and has ETH set aside for external audits
        * RJ and Griff have a deep understanding of the internal workings of this system 
    * This application could easily be converted to a Liquid Democracy application
* Current stage of development:
    * Status is finalizing the design spec 
    * The framework has been fully integrated into embark 
* Next steps:
    * Updating the smart contracts
        * Adding code coverage 
        * Adding revert strings 
        * Updating them to latest AragonOS release
    * Supporting the Status team throughout the development process
        * Our efforts will mostly be focused on the core smart contracts and advising Status in using the Aragon stack; their team will do the heavy lifting 
    * Documentation of the process to inform future interactions like this
        * Using this experience, we hope to build a consulting practice
* What we will deliver in 6 months:
    * Somewhat out of our control because of the reliance on Status' team
    * We will have onboarded Status to the Aragon Stack
    * We expect to have completed a proof of concept LiquidFunding app that can be used in a DAO
</details> 
</details>
</details>


  
 ### Onboarding & Educating the Community
<details><summary>...</summary>
  
**Our primary goal**: Provide the growing Aragon developer community direct access to experts that can guide them through the Aragon stack.

**Metrics** to measure success:
* Number of Office Hour Appointments
* Number of users added to the Aragon DAC Riot Channel 
* Number of offers for consulting services

#### 401 Online Office Hour Appointments
<details><summary>...</summary>

* Allow developers to have 15-60 minute sessions for detailed assistance on Aragon development 
    * This will keep us in touch with the needs of the greater Aragon community
    * It will give us opportunities to offer more direct consulting services
</details>

#### 402 In-Person Events
<details><summary>...</summary>

* We will attend various events with a goal for each event and a strategy to achieve that goal
* For the most part, Griff is the only member of the team that will attend these events
* There is a cap on expenses 
* Upcoming events we plan on attending: 
    * January: Meet up in Chiang Mai & during Aracon 
    * February: ETHDenver 
    * March: Ethereum Magicians, ETHCC & ETHParis
    * April: ETHCapetown
</details>

## Grant size

The Aragon DAC is requesting a 333,000 DAI one-time payment, plus 80,000 ANT with 1-year cliff and 4-year vesting period.

### Background
<details><summary>...</summary>

We spent $140,288 in the last 6 months (until Jan 7th). 
* $19,400 went to the Protofire team, for the payroll app 
* $120,888 went to the DAC

We ran out of funds and **had to take pay cuts** to continue working.
* We kept the ETH given to us by the foundation as ETH on the [Giveth DApp](https://beta.giveth.io/dacs/5b48c6f9b89c2175b538de66)
    * The price of ETH crashed and we had to trim down our scope and hiring efforts
    * We will continue to work on the stack uninterrupted under the assumption that we will be reimbursed for this work upon receiving the Flock proposal

We stabilized the structure of the team in mid-November and completed our [first formal sprint on Janurary 4th](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQkKz9pnmJ1u0ZWjOczvW5XKH9LktYND2V3RjqGd9r-Mg01C1FCoI7mwCqJNVzTKbOMEsGCouwcCmjW/pub). 
* We were challenged by the unexpected loss of hours from Arthur due to the holidays and a shift in his focus to a different Flock proposal
* We will continue these sprints and report on them in open status meetings to the community

In the few months that we have had our team together we have made significant progress on the following core pieces of the Aragon Ecosystem:

</details>

#### DAO-Dapp Interactions
<details><summary>...</summary>
  
We mainly focused our efforts on two tools that will enable Aragon DAOs to interact directly with Ethereum Dapps:

* The [Wallet Provider](https://github.com/jvluso/aragon.js/tree/wallet-provider-2/packages/aragon-wallet-provider). This allows you to use an Aragon DAO in a Truffle CLI to interact with smart contracts.  It is currently 98% complete and will likely be merged before the Flock vote.

* The [Aragon Keyring](https://github.com/jvluso/eth-aragon-keyring).  This provides the same seamless integration but for browsers on desktop and eventually mobile through their web3 provider.  

We also are have done some work in the [Frame repo](https://github.com/floating/frame/pull/119/commits) and have produced a working prototype. [Watch our 4 minute video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqb3fLNa7U8&feature=youtu.be).
</details>


#### Other repos
<details><summary>...</summary>
  
  * **aragon/aragon**:

    * Use [ProxyAddress instead of AppId](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/pull/222) for identifying apps

    * Add [error handling for dao not found](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/pull/409)

    * Remove [isNameAvailable](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/pull/388) from daoBuilder

    * aragon-wrapper: [remove KERNEL_BASE](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/pull/391)

    * Changes [to have a pre-build client](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/pull/555)

    * Add basic [cli & devchain cmd](https://github.com/aragon/aragen/pull/24)

* **Boilerplates**:

    * Update [kit.sol and dependencies](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-react-kit-boilerplate/pull/21)

    * Add environments and updated config for [react](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-react-boilerplate/pull/33), [react-kit](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-react-kit-boilerplate/pull/22) and [bare](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-bare-boilerplate/pull/12)
</details>

#### Managing Protofire
<details><summary>...</summary>

Sadly we failed to appropriately manage Protofire's development of the Payroll app. Arthur was handling the technical management well but when the ETH price crashed and funding within the DAC became uncertain we failed to communicate the situation to Protofire and halt development. This is very embarrassing for us. We have learned from this mistake and grown as a team because of it. 

Protofire has been incredibly patient with the situation but, with the loss of Arthur to the Autark team, we have chosen not to continue collaborating with Protofire on the development of the Payroll app. We will actively encourage another Flock team to support the completion of the last milestone, ideally by collaborating with the Protofire team, as they are the experts on the app and a fantastic team to work with.   

</details>
</details>

### Estimated operating costs for 2019
<details><summary>...</summary>

Part of this grant will pay us and Protofire back [for the work that has been done in the past and will be done in January](https://beta.giveth.io/dacs/5b37da13a239ac21b383d4da). 
* The last 3 [Protofire milestones](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1usLkQpKj8KYLtpa_ytiCiJscyyO-dfO6j0IcEdYdaCQ/edit?usp=sharing): 28,000 DAI
* Griff's [work for July-Jan 31st](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gSs1LFhW0eC5TvxOfkaDjFID1ObAgdADe9lgYTpA5iM/edit?usp=sharing): 21,350 DAI  
* The rest of the team up until Jan 31st: 28,150 DAI

Because of our distributed freelance-style organizational structure and focus on development we have very few costs outside of direct payment for hours worked. Our 6-month budget is split between:
* Core Team Payroll: 220,500 DAI 
* Contractors: 20,000 DAI
* Team Offsite and Travel Expenses: 15,000 DAI

In total this is **333,000 DAI**.

**Note:** We designed this proposal to be as minimal as possible to reduce the drain of funds on the Aragon Association during Crypto Winter. We are likely to expand the team in the future using other Flock proposals and the AGP process.
</details>

### ANT Package
<details><summary>...</summary>

We would like to request 80,000 ANT, with 1-year cliff and 4-year vesting for our team. No ANT will be given for previous work with the DAC.
</details>

## Organization Structure

### Legal and Financial Structure
<details><summary>...</summary>

We have no official legal entity and never intend to. We are using an Aragon DAO for governance and a Gnosis multisig to store funds. All payments will go through the Aragon DAO.

We are effectively using the cooperative model as 100% of the funds received will go to pay for salaries and expenses incurred. There is no profit taking built-in and we will maintain a transparent burn rate using this blockchain-based organizational structure.
</details>

### Team Governance
<details><summary>...</summary>

We will maintain a flat hierarchical structure and will use [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/g/rMsYTAR8/aragon-dac) to facilitate decisions that need more nuance than our Aragon DAO can offer.

We will hold open monthly status meetings (see last month's [Status Report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQkKz9pnmJ1u0ZWjOczvW5XKH9LktYND2V3RjqGd9r-Mg01C1FCoI7mwCqJNVzTKbOMEsGCouwcCmjW/pub)). We will utilize a standard agile delivery model as described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WT3XcnMw0LZOo0Q7gaKy_cFMGZ7xS3mUuIH9uilLNBU/edit). Which can be followed in real time in our [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/all-aragon-repos-5996d0a88c7c6963f4a4dfdc/boards?repos=98191281,104566586,133385725).

### Plan to Contribute to the Greater Good
<details><summary>...</summary>

We call ourselves the Aragon Decentralized Altruistic Community because we believe the Aragon ecosystem has the potential to change the way humans collaborate around [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) issues. We hope to eventually support communities that want to use the Aragon stack with the purpose of creating [new incentive structures](https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8) to align community efforts and change the world for the better in an altruistic way. 

Despite being altruistically minded, we plan on creating an Aragon consulting service and charging for our services when we interact with for-profit organizations. We will use this service to support non-profit efforts pro bono, however, they will only ever receive a maximum of 10% of our development time. Building out the Aragon infrastructure for all to use is our top concern.

The Aragon ecosystem is not ready for this effort to really begin which is why there is no mention of it in this proposal and there are no plans to support non-profit efforts in the next 6 months.
